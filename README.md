# Note-Taker--Programming-And-Data-Structures

 </br>
This assignment requires you to design and develop a ‘module note taker’ type application called “modnote”. This could be either a Windows Forms application, or a console application. Your application should have the following essential requirements:
 </br>
• It is designed as a desktop application – do not consider the application on a mobile platform, the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) etc. </br>
• It could be developed as a console application that includes these essential requirements. </br>
• Module information (title, summary content, learning outcomes, assignment due dates etc) will </br>
be held in a separate file. This information will need to be imported either by default, or if the
user selects that module from a list/drop down box etc.
• As well as being added, modules could be ‘deleted’. i.e. remove them from the application. </br>
• Each module should have ‘notes’ associated with it. The user can create a new ‘note’ which can contain text and optionally, items such as images and links. Modules could have multiple notes. ‘Notes’ should be able to be titled (such as ‘Lecture 1 notes’ etc).
• Assignments should display whether their due date has been reached or not.
• Modules can either be displayed all together (probably a bit visually cluttered), or use other
methods, such a tabbed panes, selection from a list of modules etc.
• The application should be tested to make sure it meets these requirements and that it is implemented correctly.
In addition to the essential characteristics, you could also implement:
• Have all assignments showing and sort them according to due date. (Note: this sorting algorithm should be YOUR code, not a standard algorithm accessed through the code)
• Assignments could have their own ‘notes’.
• In the ‘module notes’ or ‘assessment notes’, links could open in a separate browser or a
separate pane.
 
 </br>
Your application will be written using C#, should make use of Windows Forms (for the GUI application) and demonstrate object oriented principles in the structure of your code.
The design and testing report should contain the following:
• A design for the application which should include: o A written description of the application
o A top level Use-Case diagram
o A class diagram for:
􏰀 The Module class
􏰀 The Assignment class 􏰀 The Note class
o A sequence diagram showing message passing involving at least one of the classes implemented.
• A simple testing strategy for the application which should include: o The ‘black box’ testing strategy and results
􏰀 i.e Testing against the requirements, its description, and presenting the results in a tabular form.
o A ‘white box’ testing strategy and results
􏰀 Show testing results for ‘method coverage, statement coverage and branch
coverage’ for at least one action of the code (e.g. creating a module/assessment
note and adding content,
• The demonstration video URL.
